## Basic Details 
### Team Name: [DuoDrive] 
### Team Members - Team Lead: [Soja Jayakumar] - [College of engineering and management punnapra] - Member 2: [Ramsana N] - [College of engineering and management punnapra] 
### Project Description 
[An auto text effect is when text changes or appears automatically, often letter by letter , without anyone typing it.it makes the text look animated or alive ] 
### The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
[Improving readability → Gradual reveal can help the viewer focus on one chunk of text at a time instead of being overwhelmed.] 
### The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
[> “We solve the problem of unnoticed text by adding animation that makes each word appear like it’s telling its own story — keeping readers hooked from the first letter to the last.”] 
## Technical Details 
### Technologies/Components Used 
For Software: - [html,css,javascript] - [plain vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS ] - [ no external JS or CSS libraries are used in that code.
] - [Just a plain text/code editor (like VS Code, Sublime, or even Notepad) and a modern web browser to run and test.]
